Welcome to Velocity!

The test.sh file in this directory can be used to test the templates in the test/templates folder.
The test.sh file takes one argument: the name of the Velocity template (*.vm file). The output 
is put into test/misc/output.

For example, to display the output of the file test.vm, type the following at the command line:

	./test.sh ../templates/test.vm

Programmers working on Velocity will find these test files useful for testing whether changes to
the code have altered Velocity's expected behaviour.

The templates in the test/templates folder supplement those presented in the examples folder.

Thanks for using Velocity!

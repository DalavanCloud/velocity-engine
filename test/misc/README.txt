This directory contains some misc tests for you to ponder over.

compile.sh: This script will compile a .vm file into a .class file.
            Note: at the current time, this code is not working.
            Usage: ./compile.sh ../templates/test.vm

dump.sh: This script will dump out a text representation of the AST.
         Usage: ./dump.sh ../templates/test.vm

test.sh: This script is used for command line testing of .vm files.


thanks!

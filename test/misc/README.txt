Welcome to Velocity!

The test.sh file in this directory can be used to render the output of Velocity templates (*.vm files).

The test.sh file takes one argument: the name of the Velocity template. The output generated by the specified template can be found in test/misc/output.

For example, to display the output of the file test/misc/test.vm, type the following at the command line:

	./test.sh test.vm

Programmers working on Velocity will find the templates in test/templates useful for determining whether changes to the code have altered Velocity's expected behaviour.

If the output file is empty, velocity.log will likely hold clues to the cause of the problem. 

Thanks for using Velocity!

Now, use the #quietnull example from the global library VM_global_library.vm : 
Now, there should be nothing in the brackets : ><

Where there should be something here : >hello!<


<table>
   <tr><tdi bgcolor=blue>$10.24</td></tr>
   <tr><tdi bgcolor=blue>$15.32</td></tr>
   <tr><tdi bgcolor=blue>$12.15</td></tr>
</table>


Further tests.  The following VMs and non-VM should be properly escaped :
#tablerow
#quietnull
\#notavm
>\<

Now try to define a new quietnull VM :

It should have been rejected, as the default is to not let inlines override existing, and there
should be a message in velocity.log.
Therefore it should still function normally :
>hello!<

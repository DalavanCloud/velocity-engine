VTL Syntax Coloring in Emacs

Contributed by Brian Leonard <brian@brainslug.org> 

"Here's a small minor mode that does font-locking for vtl code.
Nothing fancy, just coloring.  As a minor mode, it insinuates itself
into whatever major mode you're using, so you don't lose the major
mode's goodness.  One caveat: it doesn't color multi-line comments as
you type.  It will color them when you fontify the entire buffer 
(M-x font-lock-fontify-buffer).

Load this file, load the file you want to edit, enable this mode with
M-x vtl-mode.  Or see the documentation for a more convenient method.
Enjoy."

o Configuration Cleanup
  
  PLAN:
  We're still debating.
  
  STATUS:
  [JVZ] I will make the changes when we agree.

o Log4j for Logging
  
  PLAN:
  Simply replace the org.apache.log package for now. Just
  a flat replacement for the features that log4j provides.
  The logging interface can come later.
  
  STATUS:
  [JVZ] I will do this if we can agree on this.
  
o Get a copy of Alexandria for Javadocs

  PLAN:
  It would be ideal to get a copy of Alexandria running
  on the apache.org box. But we can do it manually if
  necessary.
  
  STATUS:
  [JVZ] I have asked on the Alexandria mailing list to
  to see if someone will look into setting up Alexandria
  but I have heard anything back yet.

o UML Diagrams
  
  PLAN:
  Use a tool to reverse engineer the code in XMI so we have
  something to play with in Argo.
  
  STATUS:
  Ilkka Priha has made us a set of XMI files for Velocity,
  I will check them into CVS and we can go from there.
  
o Getting a mailing list archive working, or at least have
  
  PLAN:
  Can we setup Eyebrowse? Would this be too much of a PITA,
  or would be too tempted to convert it to Velocity :-)
  If no one has time for this, can we at least place
  a message at the bottom of messages that go out
  on the mailing list?
  
  STATUS:
  None
  
o Test for Texen

  PLAN:
  Just add a simple test for Texen to make sure things
  don't break when changes are made.
  
  STATUS:
  [JVZ] I will add the test for Texen.
  
o Test for Anakia
  
  PLAN:
  Just add a simple test for Anakia to make sure things
  don't break when changes are made.
  
  STATUS:
  None
  
o Codify the testing harness

  PLAN:
  Have a single target that runs the whole set of
  tests. Right now the main test is the template testing,
  it would be nice to run all the tests in there.
  
  STATUS:
  None
  
o Grinder for Velocity

  PLAN:
  Create a grinder that will stress velocity and report
  performance so that anyone interested in trying to
  improve the speed of Velocity can easily try and
  use the grinder to check the results.
  
  STATUS:
  None

Welcome to Velocity. Velocity is a general purpose template engine written in 
Java. For more information about Velocity, please look at the HTML documentation 
in the docs/ directory.

Here is a description of what each of the top level directories contains. Please 
consult the documentation in each of the lower level directories for information 
that is specific to their contents.

bin/        This is a temporary build directory.
build/      This is where the build scripts live.
docs/       This is where the documentation lives.
examples/   This is where the examples live.
src/        This is where all of the source code to Velocity lives.

BUILDING VELOCITY
-----------------

In order to get started with Velocity, you must build it first. 

To build Velocity, simply cd into the build/ directory and type:

Unix:
./build-velocity.sh

Win32:
.\build-velocity.bat

TRYING THE EXAMPLE
------------------

After building Velocity cd into the examples/ directory and run test.sh. This 
will generate a file named output which is the result of the test.wm input.

+------------- Critical For Release -------------+

o Get a copy of Alexandria for Javadocs

  PLAN:
  It would be ideal to get a copy of Alexandria running on the
  apache.org box. But we can do it manually if necessary.
  
  STATUS:
  [JVZ] I have asked on the Alexandria mailing list to
  to see if someone will look into setting up Alexandria
  but I have heard anything back yet.
  [JSS] For now, lets just use DLR's scripts to generate
  the javadocs through cron.
  [GMJ]  Is this critical, or can we just push a snapshot
       to the server, or generate it there?

o UML Diagrams
  
  PLAN:
  Use a tool to reverse engineer the code in XMI so we have
  something to play with in Argo.
  
  STATUS:
  Ilkka Priha has made us a set of XMI files for Velocity,
  I will check them into CVS and we can go from there.
  [JVZ] I've place the XMI file on the apache website
  if anyone wants to take a crack at using ArgoUML.

o Specification Directory
  PLAN:
  1. Update the bnf and ast files to reflect latest Velocity code.
  2. Make sure that the questions in the questions file 
     are all answered and dealt with.

  STATUS:
  [NONE]

+------------- Not Critical For Release -------------+

o Speed testing suite

  PLAN:
  Create a repeatable testing suite for Velocity so that it can be
  compared against other tools. In other words, other tools should also
  be plugged into this suite. We can also use this to test the relevant
  performance of changes made to Velocity.

  STATUS:
  None

o Control Caching Resource Usage

  Change resource caching to limit cache size and expire
  least-recently-used.  This is needed to prevent Vel from
  sucking up RAM uncontrollably for content-centric or 
  other sites that may use #include() or #parse() 
  extensively.

  PLAN:
  Fix code.

  STATUS:
  [GMJ] Punt for next release.

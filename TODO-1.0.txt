+------------- Critical For Release -------------+

o Configuration Cleanup
  
  PLAN:
  We're still debating.
  
  STATUS:
  [JVZ] I will make the changes when we agree.
  [JSS] At this point, I don't care.

o Log4j for Logging
  
  PLAN:
  Simply replace the org.apache.log package for now. Just a flat
  replacement for the features that log4j provides. The logging
  interface can come later.
  
  STATUS:
  [JVZ] I will do this if we can agree on this.
  [JSS] I agree.
  
o Get a copy of Alexandria for Javadocs

  PLAN:
  It would be ideal to get a copy of Alexandria running on the
  apache.org box. But we can do it manually if necessary.
  
  STATUS:
  [JVZ] I have asked on the Alexandria mailing list to
  to see if someone will look into setting up Alexandria
  but I have heard anything back yet.
  [JSS] For now, lets just use DLR's scripts to generate
  the javadocs through cron.

o UML Diagrams
  
  PLAN:
  Use a tool to reverse engineer the code in XMI so we have
  something to play with in Argo.
  
  STATUS:
  Ilkka Priha has made us a set of XMI files for Velocity,
  I will check them into CVS and we can go from there.
  [JVZ] I've place the XMI file on the apache website
  if anyone wants to take a crack at using ArgoUML.

o Specification Directory
  PLAN:
  1. Update the bnf and ast files to reflect latest Velocity code.
  2. Make sure that the questions in the questions file 
     are all answered and dealt with.

  STATUS:
  [NONE]

o Test for Texen

  PLAN:
  Just add a simple test for Texen to make sure things
  don't break when changes are made.
  
  STATUS:
  [JVZ] I will add the test for Texen.
  
o Test for Anakia
  
  PLAN:
  Just add a simple test for Anakia to make sure things
  don't break when changes are made.
  
  STATUS:
  [JSS] I will work on this one

+------------- Not Critical For Release -------------+

o Speed testing suite

  PLAN:
  Create a repeatable testing suite for Velocity so that it can be
  compared against other tools. In other words, other tools should also
  be plugged into this suite. We can also use this to test the relevant
  performance of changes made to Velocity.

  STATUS:
  None

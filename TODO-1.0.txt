o Configuration Cleanup
  
  PLAN:
  We're still debating.
  
  STATUS:
  [JVZ] I will make the changes when we agree.
  [JSS] At this point, I don't care.

o Log4j for Logging
  
  PLAN:
  Simply replace the org.apache.log package for now. Just
  a flat replacement for the features that log4j provides.
  The logging interface can come later.
  
  STATUS:
  [JVZ] I will do this if we can agree on this.
  [JSS] I agree.
  
o Get a copy of Alexandria for Javadocs

  PLAN:
  It would be ideal to get a copy of Alexandria running
  on the apache.org box. But we can do it manually if
  necessary.
  
  STATUS:
  [JVZ] I have asked on the Alexandria mailing list to
  to see if someone will look into setting up Alexandria
  but I have heard anything back yet.
  [JSS] For now, lets just use DLR's scripts to generate
  the javadocs through cron.

o UML Diagrams
  
  PLAN:
  Use a tool to reverse engineer the code in XMI so we have
  something to play with in Argo.
  
  STATUS:
  Ilkka Priha has made us a set of XMI files for Velocity,
  I will check them into CVS and we can go from there.
  
o Getting a mailing list archive working, or at least have
  
  PLAN:
  Can we setup Eyebrowse? Would this be too much of a PITA,
  or would be too tempted to convert it to Velocity :-)
  If no one has time for this, can we at least place
  a message at the bottom of messages that go out
  on the mailing list?

  COMMENTS:
  What is wrong with mail-archive.com?

  STATUS:
  [JSS] Done

o Test for Texen

  PLAN:
  Just add a simple test for Texen to make sure things
  don't break when changes are made.
  
  STATUS:
  [JVZ] I will add the test for Texen.
  
o Test for Anakia
  
  PLAN:
  Just add a simple test for Anakia to make sure things
  don't break when changes are made.
  
  STATUS:
  [JSS] I will work on this one

o Codify the testing harness

  PLAN:
  Have a single target that runs the whole set of
  tests. Right now the main test is the template testing,
  it would be nice to run all the tests in there.

  COMMENTS:
  [JSS] Lets just move the testing into its own build.xml file
        which can be called from a the main build.xml file
  
  STATUS: [daveb] DONE
  
o Speed testing suite

  PLAN:
  Create a repeatable testing suite for Velocity so that it can be 
  compared against other tools. In other words, other tools should also
  be plugged into this suite. We can also use this to test the 
  relevant performance of changes made to Velocity.

  STATUS:
  None

Welcome to Velocity!

The files in this directory demonstrate how the Velocity template engine
can be used.

1) Example.java:  This simple example shows how to use the Velocity Template Engine
in a standalone program.  It should be pre-compiled for you. Run it using the example
template provided (example.vm):

	./test.sh

the output will be in the file 'output'. 

If you wish to recompile the example, remember to include the velocity jar in your classpath, or 
just specify it on the command line :

	javac -classpath .:../bin/velocity-0.7.jar Example.java

(If there is a problem, make sure that the filename of the velocity jar hasn't changed. We can 
be forgetful at times :)


2) SimpleServlet.java:  This is a simple example of how Velocity can be used with your favorite servlet
engine. <need to review the code - gmj>


Thanks for using Velocity!

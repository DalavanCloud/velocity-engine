    with their vendor, version, description, homepage and more. Hazel comes with
    built-in templates, but also allows you to use your very own.

    Hazel uses Velocity as its template engine and, therefore, spares you from
    learning yet another proprietary template syntax.

 <section name="Velocity powered Websites">
 <p>
  This is a list of public web sites that are created using Velocity.
  This, of course, is by no means a complete listing of all of the
  Velocity powered websites.

 <p>
  Currently, in the Jakarta project, the main Jakarta website, Velocity,
  Ant, ECS, James, Jetspeed, Log4J, JMeter, Regexp, Tomcat, Turbine,
  Commons, and Alexandria projects are all rendered as static HTML using
  Velocity through the use of the Anakia XML transformation tool.

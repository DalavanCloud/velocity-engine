<section name="Conclusion">

<p>
We hope that you enjoyed this little excursion into the land of
alternatives. Every developer and user in the world has their own
opinion on the "right way" to do things. The goal of this document is
not to force anyone to believe that the Velocity way is the "Right Way",
but instead to let people see the differences between the two approaches
and allow one to develop their own opinions about the tools that are in
use today.

<p>
You make the decision.

<s1 title="Installation">

<p>
    Everything required to build Velocity comes with the distribution.
</p>

</s1>

<s1 title="Compiling">

<p>
    Execute the following script in the velocity/build directory:
</p>    

<p>
<source><![CDATA[

./build-velocity
]]></source>
</p>

<p>
    Executing the above script will create a "bin" directory within the Velocity
    distribution directory. In there will be the compiled class files (inside a 
    "classes" directory) as well as a "velocity.jar" file. You can either use 
    the .jar file directly or copy the org directory into your classpath.
</p>

<p>
    If you get compiler error about not being able to find some package, then 
    it means that you have not edited the scripts to properly specify the paths 
    to each of the packages.
</p>

</s1>

<s1 title="Testing Your Installation">

<p>
    There is testing scripts in the velocity/examples directory.
</p>

<s1 title="Getting Started">

<p>
    The purpose of this document is to define simple documentation on getting
    started with Velocity. For information about the overall structure of
    Velocity, please refer to the <a href="design.html">Design Document
    </a>. The composition of this document will be written from the
    perspective of what you should do in order to start a newly functional system.
</p>

<p>
    The first thing that you should do is download and install Velocity.
    This step is documented in the <a href="install.html">INSTALL</a>
    document, so it will not be covered here. If you would like to view the detailed API documentation
    run "build-velocity.sh|bat javadocs" from the "build" directory.  
    This will create a full set of Velocity API docs in the "docs/apidocs" directory.

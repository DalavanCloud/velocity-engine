<s1 title="View Detailed API Documentation">

<p>    
    If you are working on Unix/Linux and would like to create a full set 
    of detailed API documentation for Velocity, go to the "build" directory
    and run the following script.
    
    <source><![CDATA[
    
    ./build-velocity.sh
    
    ]]></source>
    
    If you are working on Windows, the following command will have the same 
    effect.
    
    <source><![CDATA[
    
    build-velocity.bat
    
    ]]></source>

Many people believe that Velocity can only be used in the context of web
applications. This excellent <a

such that it can be used in a myriad of applications.

 <section name="What is Velocity?">

 <p>
    Velocity is a Java-based template engine. It permits anyone to use
    the simple yet powerful template language to reference objects
    defined in Java code.
 </p>
 
 <p>
    When Velocity is used for web development, Web designers can work in
    parallel with Java programmers to develop web sites according to the
    Model-View-Controller (MVC) model, meaning that web page designers
    can focus solely on creating a site that looks good, and programmers
    can focus solely on writing top-notch code. Velocity separates Java
    code from the web pages, making the web site more maintainable over
    the long run and providing a viable alternative to <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/">Java Server Pages</a>
    (JSPs) or <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>.
 </p>

 <p>
    Velocity's capabilities reach well beyond the realm of web sites; for
    example, it can generate SQL and PostScript and XML (see <a
    href="./anakia.html">Anakia</a> for more information on XML transformations)
    from templates.  It can be used either as a standalone utility for
    generating source code and reports, or as an integrated component of other
    systems.  Velocity also provides template services for the
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/">Turbine</a> web application
    framework. Velocity+Turbine  provides a template service that will allow
    web applications to be developed according to a true MVC model.

source tree. If you are looking for the stable supported release, please
use the current release of Velocity.

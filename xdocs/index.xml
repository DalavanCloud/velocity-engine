<section name="Notice : JDOM API Change">
    <p>
        As part of their effort to reach v1.0, the JDOM
        community has made slight modifications to their API.
        This will affect Velocity users that use the 'Anakia'
        package.
    </p>

    <p>
        Velocity versions 1.4 and older require using a version
        of JDOM older than beta10rc1.  All new releases of
        Velocity will use JDOM beta10rc1 and 1.0 when it comes out.

 <section name="What is Velocity?">

 <p>
    Velocity is a Java-based template engine. It permits anyone to use
    the simple yet powerful template language to reference objects
    defined in Java code.
 </p>

 <p>
    When Velocity is used for web development, Web designers can work in
    parallel with Java programmers to develop web sites according to the
    Model-View-Controller (MVC) model, meaning that web page designers
    can focus solely on creating a site that looks good, and programmers
    can focus solely on writing top-notch code. Velocity separates Java
    code from the web pages, making the web site more maintainable over
    the long run and providing a viable alternative to <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/">Java Server Pages</a>
    (JSPs) or <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>.
 </p>

 <p>
    Velocity's capabilities reach well beyond the realm of the web;
    for example, it can be used to generate SQL and PostScript and XML
    (see <a href="./anakia.html">Anakia</a> for more information on
    XML transformations) from templates.  It can be used either as a
    standalone utility for generating source code and reports, or as
    an integrated component of other systems.  For instance, Velocity
    provides template services for the <a
    href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/">Turbine</a> web
    application framework, together providing a view engine
    facilitating development of web applications according to a true
    MVC model.

 <s1 title="What is Velocity?">

 <p>
    Velocity is a Java-based template engine. It can be used as a
    standalone utility for generating source code, HTML, reports,
    or it can be combined with other systems to provide template
    services. Velocity will be tightly integrated with the 
    <link href="http://java.apache.org/turbine/">Turbine</link>
    web application framework. Together, Velocity and Turbine provide 
    a template service that will allow web applications to be developed 
    according to a true MVC model.
 </p>    
    
 <p>    
    Velocity uses a grammar-based parser generated by 
    <link href="http://www.metamata.com/javacc/">JavaCC</link>
    (Java Compiler Compiler) using the JJTree extension to create an
    Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The AST may subsequently be traversed
    (repeatedly if desired) by a tree walker, which
    is implemented using the visitor design pattern. This allows the 
    parsing logic to be separated from the actions performed
    on the resultant AST. Two visitors come with Velocity: the first 
    visitor is produces a visual tree of the syntax and nothing more, 
    mostly used for debugging, the second actually generates output 
    from user-defined values and introspection.

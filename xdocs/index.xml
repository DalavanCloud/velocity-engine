  <section name="What is Velocity?">
 
  <p>
     Velocity is a Java-based template engine. It permits anyone to use
     a simple yet powerful template language to reference objects
     defined in Java code.
  </p>
 
  <p>
     When Velocity is used for web development, Web designers can work in
     parallel with Java programmers to develop web sites according to the
     Model-View-Controller (MVC) model, meaning that web page designers
     can focus solely on creating a site that looks good, and programmers
     can focus solely on writing top-notch code. Velocity separates Java
     code from the web pages, making the web site more maintainable over
     its lifespan and providing a viable alternative to <a
     href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/">Java Server Pages</a>
     (JSPs) or <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>.
  </p>
 
  <p>
     Velocity's capabilities reach well beyond the realm of the web;
     for example, it can be used to generate SQL, PostScript and XML
     (see <a href="docs/anakia.html">Anakia</a> for more information on
     XML transformations) from templates.  It can be used either as a
     standalone utility for generating source code and reports, or as
     an integrated component of other systems.  For instance, Velocity
     provides template services for the <a
     href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/">Turbine</a> web
     application framework, together resulting in a view engine
     facilitating development of web applications according to a true
     MVC model.

<section name="Where do I get nightly snapshots?">

<p>
    Nightly snapshots of the Velocity subversion source code tree can be found
    <a href="http://svn.apache.org/snapshots/velocity/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
These are meant to provide easy access to the actual project source control tree.
As this is our live development workspace, there are no guarantees as to
what you will find there, although we do our best to maintain a buildable
source tree. If you are looking for the stable supported release, please
use the current release of Velocity.
</p>

<p>
If you are willing to risk getting dirty, we invite you to try the
nightly snapshot to see the current state of affairs. (and help out!) <a
href="http://www.apache.org/dev/version-control.html">Public Subversion
access</a> is also available.

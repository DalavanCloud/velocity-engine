 <section name="What is Velocity?">

 <p>
    Velocity is a Java-based template engine. It permits anyone to use
    the simple yet powerful template language to reference objects
    defined in Java code.
 </p>

 <p>
    When Velocity is used for web development, Web designers can work in
    parallel with Java programmers to develop web sites according to the
    Model-View-Controller (MVC) model, meaning that web page designers
    can focus solely on creating a site that looks good, and programmers
    can focus solely on writing top-notch code. Velocity separates Java
    code from the web pages, making the web site more maintainable over
    the long run and providing a viable alternative to <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/">Java Server Pages</a>
    (JSPs) or <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>.
 </p>

 <p>
    Velocity's capabilities reach well beyond the realm of the web;
    for example, it can be used to generate SQL and PostScript and XML
    (see <a href="./anakia.html">Anakia</a> for more information on
    XML transformations) from templates.  It can be used either as a
    standalone utility for generating source code and reports, or as
    an integrated component of other systems.  For instance, Velocity
    provides template services for the <a
    href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/">Turbine</a> web
    application framework, together providing a view engine
    facilitating development of web applications according to a true
    MVC model.

<section name="Where do I get nightly snapshots?">

<p>
    Nightly snapshots of the Velocity CVS can be found
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-velocity/nightly/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
These are meant to provide easy access to the actual project CVS tree.
As this is our live development workspace, there are no guarantees as to
what you will find there,although we do our best to maintain a buildable
source tree. If you are looking for the stable supported release, please
use the current release of Velocity.
</p>

<p>
If you are willing to risk getting dirty, we invite you to try the
nightly snapshot to see the current state of affairs (and help out!) <a

access</a> is also available.

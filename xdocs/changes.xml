      <action type="fix" dev="henning" issue="VELOCITY-426" due-to="Malcom Edgar">
        Revert the split between org.apache.velocity.runtime.parser.node.Node and
        org.apache.velocity.runtime.parser.Node. The parser now only uses ...parser.node.Node
        because this change broke custom directives.

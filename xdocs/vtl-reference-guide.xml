<s1 title="About this Guide">

<p>
    This guide is meant to be the definitive reference for
    the Velocity Template Language (VTL).
</p> 

</s1>

<s1 title="References">

<p>
    There are three types of references in the VTL: variables, properties
    and methods. As a designer using the VTL, you must come to an agreement
    with your engineers as to what the specific names of references are so
    you can use them correctly in your templates.

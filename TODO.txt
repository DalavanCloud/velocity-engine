o Specification Files
  PLAN:
  1. Update the BNF and AST files to reflect latest Velocity code.
  2. Make sure that the questions in the questions file 
     are all answered and dealt with.

  STATUS:
  [NONE]


o UML Diagrams
  
  PLAN:
  Use a tool to reverse engineer the code in XMI so we have
  something to play with in Argo.
  
  STATUS:
  Ilkka Priha has made us a set of XMI files for Velocity,
  I will check them into CVS and we can go from there.
  [JVZ] I've place the XMI file on the apache website
  if anyone wants to take a crack at using ArgoUML.

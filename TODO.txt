No blockers.


+------------- Not Critical For Release -------------+

o Drop use of Log4J Category class

  PLAN: Replace with org.apache.log4j.Logger.

  STATUS:
  [DLR] I will implement this for 1.5 (has open Bugzilla issue).


o Control Caching Resource Usage

  Change resource caching to limit cache size and expire
  least-recently-used.  This is needed to prevent Vel from
  sucking up RAM uncontrollably for content-centric or 
  other sites that may use #include() or #parse() 
  extensively.

  PLAN:
  Fix code using org.apache.commons.collections.LRUMap class.

  STATUS:
  [GMJ] Punt for next release.
  [DLR] I will implement this for 1.5.


o Specification Files
  PLAN:
  1. Update the BNF and AST files to reflect latest Velocity code.
  2. Make sure that the questions in the questions file 
     are all answered and dealt with.

  STATUS:
  [NONE]


o UML Diagrams
  
  PLAN:
  Use a tool to reverse engineer the code in XMI so we have
  something to play with in Argo.
  
  STATUS:
  Ilkka Priha has made us a set of XMI files for Velocity,
  I will check them into CVS and we can go from there.
  [JVZ] I've place the XMI file on the apache website
  if anyone wants to take a crack at using ArgoUML.
